# Overview

This program is the analysis of different characters from the popular anime Naruto. I created this CSV file myself and it included only 44 characters of my choice each with their name, village, age and their rank (1-10) according to my own opinion. 

The purpose of this analysis was to learn more about the Pandas library and the characters in Naruto. As a student at BYU-I, I am trying to further my knowledge of programming, Python, and data analysis.

# Data Analysis Results

Some general questions that I was trying to answer were just how to use the Pandas Library and to do that, I would watch videos and look at the documentation while trying to answer my data specific questions. My data specific questions were, do the characters get more experienced as you get older, and how to sort the characters by village and rank. To answer the first question, I set up a function that would get the average age for each rank on the scale 1 to 10 and display it on a graph and table. I created another function that would filter out the characters within a certain village and then rank them by their rank, age, Or alphabetically.

# Development Environment

To complete this program, I used the Python programming language with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

# Useful Websites

* [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [Plotting with matplotlib](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13.1/visualization.html)

# Future Work

* I would like to make the code more readable and make the functions smaller with less if statements.
* The user interface could have some better features with being able to maybe click what the user wants to do rather than type it in which would cause errors.
